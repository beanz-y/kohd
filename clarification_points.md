Okay, I will summarize the clarification points you provided for generating `Kohd` within the Motherboard campaign frame.

**Subroutine 1: Nodal Word Glyph Construction**

* **Charge Node Placement:**
    * The placement of the charge node is relative to the first letter of the word.
    * Its placement is also dependent on the flow of the word and the trace lines connected to the starting node.
    * The charge node must be dynamic but remain connected and next to the starting letter's node.
    * The Charge node is solely to identify the start of a word.

* **Trace Line Paths:**
    * Trace lines are stylized to resemble a circuit board.
    * Stylistically, a trace should start with a short horizontal or vertical segment, then go diagonally to the next node.
    * If the next node is directly adjacent (horizontally or vertically), a direct horizontal or vertical line is acceptable.

* **Subnode Placement and Count:**
    * Both the placement and count of subnodes are significant, as is their order from the starting node to the ending node.
    * The fundamental rule for subnode count is:
        * 1 subnode for the first letter in a node group (e.g., A, D, G, J, M, P, S, V, Y).
        * 2 subnodes for the second letter in a node group (e.g., B, E, H, K, N, Q, T, W, Z).
        * 3 subnodes for the third letter in a node group (e.g., C, F, I, L, O, R, U, X).
    * If a word starts with multiple letters from the *same initial node*, the subnodes for these initial letters are placed sequentially on the first trace line that leads *away* from this initial node *to the next different node* in the word.
    * For words where all letters are in the *same single node* (e.g., "MOON" from the MNO node), there is a single trace line from that node to the ground indicator. Along this single trace line, the sequence of subnodes would be, for example, 1 (for M), 3 (for O), 3 (for the second O), and 2 (for N).
    * There should be a reasonable space between subnodes that represent individual letters.

* **Node Rings:**
    * Node rings should be used whenever a trace line needs to connect to *any previously visited node* within the current word's path to maintain clarity and prevent ambiguity.
    * For example, in a word like "ABCB," when the trace returns from node C to node B, node B would require a ring.

* **Null Modifier:**
    * **When Required:**
        * A null modifier is required when there is ambiguity as to which node the starting node is when viewing the word after generation. For example, without it, a word starting on node `DEF` and going to `JKL` might be misinterpreted if the glyph could also appear to start on other nodes like `GHI`.
        * Words using only two nodes (vertically or horizontally adjacent) require a null modifier. Diagonal two-node words also generally require it, as per the original document's example of vagueness.
        * Words using three nodes that are all in a single straight vertical or horizontal line also require a null modifier.
        * An exception is for three-node words in a clear diagonal line (e.g., top-left, center, bottom-right), which do *not* require a null modifier.
    * **Placement Logic:**
        * Determine the minimal "bounding box" that encloses all active nodes used in the word.
        * Identify corners of the 3x3 grid that fall *outside* this bounding box.
        * If multiple such external corners exist, prioritize placement by selecting:
            1.  The **bottom-right** available corner first.
            2.  Else, the **bottom-left** available corner.
            3.  Else, the **top-right** available corner.
            4.  Else, the **top-left** available corner.

**Subroutine 2: Sentence Construction**

* **Coupler Design:**
    * The design of the coupler (which signifies the beginning of a sentence) can be randomized or varied.
    * It is meant to resemble a connection point on a computer board (e.g., a PCIe slot), and there is no significance to the specific lengths of its bars in the example.

* **Lexicon Word Placement:**
    * Lexicon words (short, predefined symbols) should be placed to allow clear trace line flow and fit visually within the sentence structure. This is primarily a visual spacing consideration.

* **"From-to" and "If-then" Lexicon Words:**
    * These lexicon words are placed *between* the trace lines connecting two nodally constructed words.
    * The trace from the prior constructed word would connect to the "from-to" (or "if-then") lexicon symbol, and then a new trace would connect from that lexicon symbol to the next constructed word, effectively making the lexicon symbol a node in the sentence's circuit path.

* **Comma Placement:**
    * Commas are represented by two vertical lines that intersect and are perpendicular to the trace line they divide between words.

* **Circuit Connection Aesthetics (between words):**
    * The connections should generally follow the aesthetics of circuit board design to maintain the theme.
