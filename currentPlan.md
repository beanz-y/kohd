Okay, thank you for those detailed clarifications! This gives us a much clearer picture of the desired aesthetics and rules for trace pathing. This is indeed a complex challenge, especially with the requirements for obstacle avoidance and parallel routing, but it's definitely an interesting one.

Based on your feedback, here's a summary of our refined understanding and a proposed plan for moving forward.

**Refined Understanding of Requirements:**

1.  **Trace Pathing Style:**
    * **Adjacent Nodes (Horizontal/Vertical):** Straight lines are acceptable.
    * **Diagonal Pathing:** The core pattern is: `short initial H/V segment` -> `45-degree turn` -> `long diagonal segment` -> (potentially more turns/segments for avoidance) -> `short final H/V segment` to connect to the target node/ring.
    * **Aesthetic Goal:** Resemble PCB traces, with "bus lanes" where traces run parallel and offset if they share common paths.

2.  **Path Selection & Obstacle Avoidance:**
    * Prioritize the shortest/least complex path that adheres to the style.
    * **Crucially, paths must route around uninvolved nodes and previously drawn trace lines.** The "MOTHERBOARD" PDF glyph (e.g., STU to GHI trace avoiding VWX and PQR) is a key visual reference for this behavior.
    * The length of the initial/final "short H/V segments" will be dynamic, influenced by the avoidance pathing.

3.  **Parallel Traces:**
    * Traces that would naturally overlap or follow the same route (like the multiple traces from ABC to MNO/PQR in the PDF) must be drawn parallel to each other with a small offset. They should not use the exact same path.

4.  **Subnode Placement:**
    * Subnode groups (especially those with 2 or 3 dots) should be placed on a straight segment of a trace that can accommodate the entire group, maintaining both intra-group and inter-group spacing.

5.  **Charge/Ground Indicators:** The current direct-line approach (at a clear angle) is acceptable for now.

6.  **Current Scope:** We are focusing solely on generating single, complete word glyphs.

**Brainstorming Implementation Strategies:**

This problem combines elements of pathfinding (like A*) with strict aesthetic rules and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Here's a high-level overview of how we might approach this:

1.  **Path Generation Engine (Conceptual `TraceRouter`):**
    * This would be a new component or set of functions responsible for calculating the actual `(x,y)` point sequences for each trace line.
    * It would take the start and end nodes (and their ring connection levels), the list of all node positions, uninvolved nodes (as obstacles), and already drawn traces (as dynamic obstacles).
    * The core algorithm would likely be a modified pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A* or a specialized procedural router) that:
        * Favors paths made of horizontal, vertical, and 45-degree diagonal segments.
        * Tries to construct the `short H/V -> diagonal -> short H/V` pattern.
        * Penalizes paths that intersect obstacles (other nodes, existing traces).
        * Includes logic to "jog" or route around obstacles.

2.  **Handling Parallel Traces:**
    * This is one of_the most complex aspects.
    * One approach could be to identify "buses" or common path segments. A "master" path for the bus could be routed first, and then individual traces assigned "lanes" with slight offsets.
    * This also means that the connection points on the source/target nodes for these parallel traces will need to be fanned out slightly, rather than all originating/terminating at the exact same point on the node's circumference.

3.  **Data Structure for Traces:**
    * The `glyph_elements` generated by `KohdGlyphBuilder` for a 'trace' will need to be enhanced. Instead of just storing start/end nodes, it will need to store a list of `(x,y)` points representing the calculated, possibly multi-segment, path.

**Proposed Next Steps for Code Modification:**

Given the complexity, I suggest a phased approach. The immediate next step should be to enable the `KohdCanvasWidget` to *draw* arbitrary multi-segment paths and to adapt subnode placement to these paths. This decouples the drawing capability from the complex path *generation* logic.

**Phase 1: Enabling Multi-Segment Path Drawing and Subnode Adaptation**

1.  **Modify `KohdGlyphBuilder` (`glyph_builder.py`):**
    * Change the structure of 'trace' elements in `self.glyph_elements`. It should now include a `path_points: list[tuple[float, float]]` field.
    * Initially, for testing, `_rebuild_glyph_elements_for_string` can populate `path_points` with just two points (the direct connection points currently calculated).
        ```python
        # Example snippet for current direct path
        # visual_start_point = self._calculate_connection_point_on_node_circumference(...)
        # visual_end_point = self._calculate_connection_point_on_node_circumference(...)
        # element['path_points'] = [
        #     (visual_start_point.x(), visual_start_point.y()),
        #     (visual_end_point.x(), visual_end_point.y())
        # ]
        ```
        Later, a dedicated `TraceRouter` component will be responsible for calculating the detailed `path_points` with all the bends and segments.

2.  **Modify `KohdCanvasWidget` (`kohd_canvas.py`):**
    * **Trace Drawing:** In `paintEvent`, when rendering a 'trace' element:
        * Retrieve its `path_points`.
        * If `path_points` has two or more points, iterate through them and draw line segments connecting `path_points[i]` to `path_points[i+1]`.
    * **Subnode Drawing (`_draw_subnodes_on_line` function):**
        * This function will need a significant update. It should now accept the `path_points: list[QPointF]` (or equivalent) for the trace.
        * **Logic:**
            1.  Calculate the total length of the entire multi-segment path.
            2.  For each subnode dot to be drawn:
                a.  Determine its cumulative distance from the start of the path (this uses the existing `current_distance_along_trace` logic, which considers inter-group and intra-group spacing).
                b.  Iterate through the segments of the `path_points`. For each segment:
                    i.  If the subnode's cumulative distance falls within the current segment's span (after accounting for lengths of previous segments):
                        * Calculate the exact `QPointF` for the subnode on this segment.
                        * Draw the subnode dot.
                        * Move to the next subnode.
                    ii. Else, subtract the current segment's length from the subnode's cumulative distance and proceed to the next segment.
            3.  Ensure that a group of subnodes (e.g., 2 or 3 dots for a single letter) is preferably placed on a single straight segment of the path if that segment is long enough. This might require looking ahead when placing the first dot of a group.

**Why this approach?**

* **Decoupling:** Separates the concern of *drawing* complex paths from *generating* them.
* **Iterative Development:** We can focus on making the canvas render paths correctly first. Then, we can iteratively develop the `TraceRouter` to produce increasingly sophisticated paths (basic stylized -> node avoidance -> trace avoidance & parallelism).
* **Testability:** It will be easier to test the `TraceRouter` if the canvas can already visualize its output.

This first phase is a foundational step. Once the canvas can render these arbitrary paths and place subnodes correctly along them, we can then tackle the algorithmic challenges of the `TraceRouter`.

Does this phased plan make sense as a way to proceed? We can start by modifying the data structures and the drawing logic in `KohdCanvasWidget` to support these `path_points`.
